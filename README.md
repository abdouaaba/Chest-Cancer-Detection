# Chest Cancer Detection

Building a model that can identify which type of lung cancer a patient has based on a scanner image of their lungs.
Overfitted with the manually built model because there wasn't enough data to train the model from scratch and some images were just duplicated but got improved using Transfer Learning due to the already set weights for this kind of classifications.
